# Responsive-Portfolio

Just a note:

I spent an hour on Sunday and literally 12 hours Monday studying & looking at everything and find myself going from understanding 
concepts when talking about them out loud and initial stabs to getting more and more lost.

By Monday night I had spent most of the day just trying to do the responsive homework and feeling more and more confused.

Tuesday I will contact Staff and see about getting extra help. This is terrifying.
